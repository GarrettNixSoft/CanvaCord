# CanvaCord

CanvaCord is an open-source tool for creating links between a student Canvas account and the Discord social platform.

## Overview

Users running CanvaCord can create one or more Instances to serve as a bridge between a Canvas Course and a Discord Server. When creating an Instance, users can configure a variety of settings to customize how that Instance behaves. From the frequency of updates from Canvas to the schedule of notifications sent to Discord, to creating custom Roles users can use to opt in and out of different notification categories, CanvaCord is built to be flexible.

## Setup

Before getting started with CanvaCord, users need to have a Canvas account and a Discord Bot to use.

Users can obtain an Access Token to the Canvas API from their [Canvas account settings page](https://csulb.instructure.com/profile/settings).

Discord bots can be created via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).

When running CanvaCord for the first time, a prompt will appear asking them to enter these access tokens, along with the URL for their institution's Canvas platform and their Canvas user ID.
